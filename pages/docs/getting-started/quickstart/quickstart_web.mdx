# Quickstart (Web) 🚀

Engineering prompts and Integarte them into your project in less than 5 minutes.

> We are currently in closed alpha. If you would like to try out Promptmodel, visit [here](https://app.promptmodel.run).  
> You can also request a personal demo [here](https://calendly.com/sounhochung/30min).

## Make Project

First, you should make organization and project.

{/* ![Make Project](./img/make_project.gif) */}

## Prompt Engineering

In quickstart, we will show the basic usage of our service with class `PromptModel`.  

> If you are interested in `Chatmodel` (for chatbot), please check [Chatmodel Editor](/docs/webpage/development_dashboard/chatmodel)

### Create your first PromptModel

Create your First PromptModel with name.

{/* ![Make First PromptModel in Node Code](/demos/make_promptmodel_no_code.gif) */}

### Crafting your first prompt

Write and run your first prompt in the dashboard. You can view the output from the panel below.

{/* ![First prompt in Web](/demos/engineering_no_code.gif) */}

#### I/O variables syntax

Placeholder for **inputs** can be defined just like writing a python f-string; by using curly braces `{}`.

```txt
Extract keywords from given passage:
{passage}
```

We provide parsing and automatic type conversion for LLM outputs. Currently supported parsing types are:

- Square brackets
- Double square brackets
- Html

Here is an example format for double square brackets:

```txt
[[variable type=str]]
output value here will be parsed correctly
[[variable]]
```

More output formats will be supported very soon. Synatx highlighting for prompts is also coming soon.

### Prompt engineering workflow

You can create new versions of your promptmodels by clicking the **Create Variant** button in the dashboard.

![Creating variant demo](../img/promptmodel-demo-variant.gif)

You can view differences with the previous version while writing your new version, which is a great way to keep track of your changes.

A new prompt version is created every time you click the **Run** button in the dashboard. Each version is automatically categorized into either `broken` or `working`, depending on whether the run was successful or not. You can evaulate the output, then update the category of the best prompt versions to `candidate`.

### Pushing prompt versions to deployment

Once you have at least one candidate prompt version, you can push the candidates to deployment by clicking the **Push to deployment** button in the dashboard. This will upload the candidate versions to the cloud, and make them available for use in deployment.

You can view and manage your deployed prompt versions in the deployment dashboard.

LLM token usage, latency, costs will be tracked for each promptmodel run. You can view these metrics in the deployment dashboard. _(coming soon)_

  Metric visualization & analytics based on human & LLM evaluation is also
  coming soon.
</Callout>

## Prompt Management

You can use the deployment dashboard to manage your deployed prompts.

Here you can publish specific prompt versions for use in deployment, create A/B tests _(coming soon)_, and view prompt usage statistics.

## Integate with your code

You can use the deployed prompts in your code by using the our python SDK.

### Installation

To install `promptmodel` run:

```bash copy
pip install promptmodel
```

### Add your API key

First, you should add your API key to your environment variables.

You can get your API key for your project in the Project Settings page.

{/* ![Project Settings](../img/promptmodel-project-settings.png) */}

Copy your project API key and add it to your environment variables.

```bash copy filename=".env"
PROMPTMODEL_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Use the SDK

You can use the SDK to run your prompts in your code.  
You just call `init()` and write down the name of your prompts.

```python filename="your_code.py"
import promptmodel
from promptmodel import PromptModel

promptmodel.init()

res = PromptModel("say_hi").run(
	inputs={},
	function_list={}
)
print(res.raw_output)
# Example Output : "hi"
```

If you change your deployment prompt version in the **Deployment Dashboard**, Your code will automatically use that version.

### Check Logs

Logs from your LLM usages are automatically collected and stored in the cloud.  
You can view the logs in the **Deployment Dashboard**.
