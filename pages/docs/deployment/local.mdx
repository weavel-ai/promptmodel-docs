# Local Machine

We provide `docker-compose.yml` to run the application locally.

You can run the `Promptmodel` Dashboard, Backend and Postgres DB with the following single command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Requirements: docker and docker compose, both included in Docker Desktop

## Start
```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/weavel-ai/promptmodel.git
cd promptmodel

docker compose up
```

-> Visit http://localhost:3000

This will build the docker images of frontend Dashboard, backend server, postgres database, redis and redis-listener.

## Upgrade

```bash
cd promptmodel

git pull
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```
