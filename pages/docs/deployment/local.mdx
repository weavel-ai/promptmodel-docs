# Local Machine

We provide `docker-compose.yml` for running the application locally.

You can serve all services that compose **Promptmodel** with a single command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

> Requirements: docker and docker compose, both included in Docker Desktop

## Get started

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/weavel-ai/promptmodel.git
cd promptmodel

docker compose up
```

-> Visit http://localhost:3000

> This will build the docker images of a Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend server, postgres database, redis and postgres-redis listener for realtime.

## Update to latest version

```bash
cd promptmodel

git pull
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

Promptmodel Cloud is a managed version of Promptmodel, with automatic updates and more features.  
You can get started with a free plan [here](https://app.promptmodel.run).

## Local development

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml watch
```

For development, we provide `docker-compose.dev.yml` which allows `docker compose watch` - changes in the codebase will be detected and related containers will automatically sync/rebuild.

> This feature was introduced in Docker Compose 2.2.2. [Read more →](https://docs.docker.com/compose/file-watch/)

`docker compose watch` isn't supported on remote code

## Connect to codebase

You can connect your codebase with the self-hosted Promptmodel by Python SDK.
