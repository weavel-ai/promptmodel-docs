# UnitLogger

**UnitLogger** is a simple logging system that makes it easy to log your code unit with LLM calls.

You can log your traces with multi step of LLM calls easily.

> Currently, it only works works with **FunctionModel** class.  
> We will integrate this with **ChatModel** class as soon as possible.

## Example Code

```python
from promptmodel import init, UnitLogger, FunctionModel

init()

async def copilot(user_message):
    unit = UnitLogger(name="copilot_unit", version=1).log_start() # start the trace

    planner = FunctionModel("planner", unit_config=unit.config) 
    res = planner.run({"user_message" : user_message}) # 1st LLM call
    planner.log_score({"accuracy" : 0.9})

    executor = FunctionModel("executor", unit_config=unit.config)
    res = executor.run({"plan" : res.raw_output, "user_message" : user_message}) # 2nd LLM call
    executor.log_score({"accuracy" : 0.8})

    unit.log_score({"user_liked" : 1})

    return res.raw_output
```

This example code show that how to log your code unit with multi-step of LLM calls.

After you log your code unit, you can see the trace in the **Unit Dashboard**.

You can easily see the trace, latency, and correlation between thee each LLM call's score and the overall trace's score.

## Methods & Attributes

**Methods**
- `log_start` creates the initial point of the trace logging. It returns a **UnitLogger** object itself.
- `log_score` can log any score key-value pairs in the trace.

**Attributes**
- `config` have the configuration data of the `UnitLogger` object. If you want to add any LLM call logs in the trace, just give this value to the `FunctionModel` class.

### log_start

`log_start` method is the initial point of the trace you want to log.
It will return a **UnitLogger** object itself, filled with the configuration data.

```python
unit = UnitLogger(name="copilot_unit", version=1).log_start()
```

You can give the `name` and `version` of the trace you want to log.

After you call this method, you can use the `unit.config` attribute to log any LLM call in the trace.

```python
planner = FunctionModel("planner", unit_config=unit.config)
res = planner.run({"user_message" : user_message}) # This LLM call will be logged in the trace automatically.
```

### log_score

`log_score` method can log any score key-value pairs in the trace.
As same as `FunctionModel.log_score` method, you can give any key-value pairs to this method.

```python
unit.log_score({"user_liked" : 1})
```
