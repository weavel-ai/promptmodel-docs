# Introduction

**Promptmodel** is a collaborative prompt & model engineering framework that offers the following:

- [x] **Versioning** for every prompt that you run so that you never lose track of your experiments.
- [x] **Web editor** designed for prompt engineering with difference visualization & built-in version tracking.
- [x] **SDK** (Python) to integrate the prompts with your existing codebase.
- [x] **Dashboard** for product-level evaluation & prompt management (A/B tests coming soon).

We are currently in **public beta**. You can request a personal demo [here](./schedule-demo.mdx).  
Stay updated by following us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2Y36M36tZf).

## Getting Started

We recommend following our [Interactive demo](./demo) to get started with Promptmodel.

## Prompt Engineering & Management

Engineer prompts with built-in version control and manage published versions without redeploying your code.

### Codebase connection via ClI & SDK (Optional)

You can connect your codebase to the dashboard via our CLI & SDK. (`prompt connect`)

This allows the following:

- Flexibiliy to define API keys in your codebase (`.env` file) and use them for LLM calls from the dashboard.
- Availability to execute functions in your code from the dashboard. (for function calls)
- Codebase synchronization that allows you to simply add a new FunctionModel/ChatModel in your code and have it automatically appear in the dashboard.

## Logging & Evaluation

You can also view and evaluate production-level logs on the dashboard.
We support (or will support) the following features:

- [x] Logging
- [x] Metric visualization (latency, token usage, costs, etc.)
- [x] Publishted prompt version control
- [ ] A/B tests
- [ ] Evaluation
- [ ] Demo chatbot UI for testing (for ChatModel)

## SDK Components

Our SDK allows you to integrate prompts with your existing codebase (CI/CD for prompts).  
It also allows you to connect your codebase with the dashboard for code synchronization and function call support.

### LLM Calls & Logging

[FunctionModel](/docs/integrations/python-sdk/functionmodel)  
**FunctionModel** is for a combination of prompts and an LLM model that works as a semantic function.

- [x] Version control
- [x] Logging

[ChatModel](/docs/integrations/python-sdk/chatmodel)  
**ChatModel** is for chatbots with a single system prompt as a personality.

- [x] Version control
- [x] Logging

[ChatAgent (coming soon)]()  
**ChatAgent** is a utility for logging data from any custom agent architecture.

- [x] Logging

### Integration with Development Dashboard

[DevApp]() and [DevClient]()  
**DevApp** connects your local codebase with the development dashboard via websockets.  
**DevClient** registers local _functionmodel_ usage to your DevApp.

You can use our **CLI** to generate an initial file with DevApp, and create & open a new development environment.
You can utilize the codebase-synchronized development dashboard to engineer function call usage and register input samples for your prompts.
